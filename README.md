# Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

## Your Task

This project is a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an [SVG file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.

## Sample

The following image shows a sample generated SVG given the following input entered by the user: `MEW` for the text, `white` for the text color, `circle` from the list of shapes, and `blue` for the shape color. Note that this is just an image of the output SVG and not the SVG file itself:
